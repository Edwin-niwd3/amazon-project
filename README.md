# This is a remake of my old javascript project, where I made the Amazon website solely using javascript

I am in the process of making the Amazon website again by using React, I am doing this on my own, and it will be published as soon as it is finished as a website through Git Hub.

# Currently need to do

- Make the Checkout Page
  - Show products currently in the cart
  - Offer button that allows user to change the amount of any item in the cart
  - Allow users to delete items from the cart
  - Allow users to select an arrival date
  - Create a total price section.
    - The total price section should be dynamic, changing depending on what option the user selects for their items in the cart
    - Total price should also change based on what arrival date the user wants
- Make the Orders Page
  - Feature all the products that have been ordered, and when they will arrive
  - Allow users to track any specific product to see what the progress on the product is
- Implement a Search function into the website
  - Allow users to search for a specific product (Maybe be able to suggest products depending on how closely it is spelled?
- Implement a Tracking page for a specific ordered product through the Orders page
  - A simple green bar that progresses depending on how far along the date has progressed


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
